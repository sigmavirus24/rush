# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest version is the only version supported for security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Email me via the address listed on my GitHub profile. If desired, there's also a PGP key associated with that that can be found on Keybase or another PGP server.

Updates/fixes may not be on a fast or immediate schedule. I don't have significant time for open source these days.
