====================================
 2021.04.0 - Released on 2021-04-01
====================================


Backwards Incompatibilities
===========================

- Add ``compare_and_swap`` method to Base store definition for atomic
  operations.

  This allows limiters to ensure there are no race-conditions by having the
  stores provide atomic interfaces.  See also
  :class:`~rush.stores.base.BaseStore`.


Bugs Fixed
==========

- Update built-in limiters to rely on ``compare_and_swap`` method from storage
  backends.


Features
========

- Add a decorator in ``rush.contrib.decorator`` written by `Jude188`_ for
  potentially easier use of the library.  See also
  :class:`~rush.contrib.decorator.ThrottleDecorator`.
